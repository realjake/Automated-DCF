        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Detailed Output Reports:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Generates detailed reports on all intermediate calculations including reinvestment rates, WACC components, and FCFF.</li>
            <li>Offers a final fair value estimation compared against current market value, including a sensitivity analysis to see different trends.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Technical Analysis Integration:</b>

            <li>Leverages historical financial data to calculate trimmed mean reinvestment rates and historical revenue growth patterns.</li>
            <li>Utilizes long-term historical data to support more accurate future projections in the DCF model.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Comprehensive Assumptions and Outputs:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Clearly documents assumptions for EBIT margins, revenue growth, tax rates, and FCFF.</li>
            <li>Considers non-current assets, net liabilities, and cash holdings in the final equity value calculation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why DCF is Subjective</h2>
<p>
    While DCF is a powerful tool for valuation, it's important to understand its inherent subjectivity due to several factors:
</p>

<h3>Qualitative Factors</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Market Sentiment:</b> Investor psychology and market conditions can lead to deviations from intrinsic value.</li>
    <li><b>Competitive Landscape:</b> Industry dynamics, competitive positioning, and potential market disruptions are qualitative factors that aren't fully captured by quantitative models.</li>
    <li><b>Management Quality:</b> The effectiveness of a company's leadership and their strategic decisions can influence future performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changing Fundamentals</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Economic Conditions:</b> Macroeconomic factors and geopolitical events can alter a company's future prospects.</li>
    <li><b>Technological Advancements:</b> Innovation and technological changes can impact a company‚Äôs growth trajectory and competitive advantage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Scope</h2>
<p>
    This project focuses on the quantitative aspects of DCF analysis, providing a robust framework to calculate perceived value based on the following inputs:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Analyst EBIT Estimates:</b> Earnings before interest and taxes as projected by financial analysts.</li>
    <li><b>Analyst Revenue Growth Estimates:</b> Expected growth rates for company revenue.</li>
    <li><b>Perpetual Growth Rate:</b> Typically derived from long-term government bond yields to represent a stable growth rate.</li>
    <li><b>Effective Tax Rate Predictions:</b> Anticipated tax rates applied to future earnings.</li>
</ul>
