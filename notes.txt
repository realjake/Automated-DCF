Adjust the beta to reflect total risk rather than market risk. This adjustment is a 
relatively simple one, since the R squared of the regression measures the 
proportion of the risk that is market risk. 
 Total Beta = Market Beta / Correlation of the sector with the market
 To estimate the beta for Kristin Kandy, we begin with the bottom-up 
unlevered beta of food processing companies:
• Unlevered beta for publicly traded food processing companies = 0.78
• Average correlation of food processing companies with market = 0.333
• Unlevered total beta for Kristin Kandy = 0.78/0.333 = 2.34
• Debt to equity ratio for Kristin Kandy = 0.3/0.7 (assumed industry average)
• Total Beta = 2.34 ( 1- (1-.40)(30/70)) = 2.94
• Total Cost of Equity = 4.50% + 2.94 (4%) = 16.26%
